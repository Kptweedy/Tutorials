3.3. Search the Asset Library for the material, if it exists move on to the next step, if it does not exist in the asset library you will need to manually add it to the asset library. For how to do that refer to [Setting up Asset Library Materials](#al-material-setup)

4. Inside the materials collection select one of the objects, and drag and drop the material onto that object.  

![Asset Drop](../../assets/images/asset-lib-drop.png)  

4.1. Keep the object that you had previously dropped the material on to selected and then select the rest of the objects inside the collection, if the object is no longer the active object shift click it, then you can press Ctrl+L and link the materials.
