Once you're done, close the file and return to the model you're working on.</p> <p>Follow these steps to add the shader to your scene:</p> <ol> <li>Go to File &gt; Append.</li> <li>Select the CharacterFillDeferred.blend file you just downloaded.</li> <li>Navigate to Materials and choose the material that fits the description (for example, Garuda or Khora).</li> </ol> <p>Be aware that Blender may freeze during this process, and the duration can vary from nearly instantaneous to several minutes depending on your hardware. Visually, no changes will appear immediately.</p> <p>Applying and Renaming the Shader in Blender</p> <ol> <li>Switch to the Shading tab and select any mesh.</li> <li>In the shading panel, you will see the material currently applied to the selected mesh.</li> <li>Click on the arrow next to the material's name, and from the dropdown list, select the material you appended earlier.</li> </ol> <p>Blender will likely freeze for a longer period than before. Once it responds, the shader will be applied to the mesh, but the name will be incorrect since the shader was originally designed for a different mesh with a different name.</p> <p>To resolve this, you have two options:</p> <p>Option 1: Copy and Paste the Shader Data</p> <ol> <li>In the Shading tab, press A (to select all shader nodes), then press Ctrl + C (to copy).</li> <li>Switch the material back to the one that was originally assigned to the mesh.</li> <li>Press A again (to select all nodes in the current material), then press Del (to delete them).</li> <li>Finally, press Ctrl + V (to paste the shader data).</li> </ol> <p>Option 2: Rename the Material</p> <ol> <li>Click on the material's name and rename it to the one you want to use.</li> <li>Note: The names must be unique.
